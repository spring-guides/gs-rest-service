# Getting Started: Building a RESTful Web Service

What you'll build
-----------------

This guide walks you through creating a "hello world" [RESTful web service][u-rest] with Spring. The service will accept HTTP GET requests at:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting

and respond with a [JSON][u-json] representation of a greeting:

```json
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:

```json
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
```

Create a resource representation class
--------------------------------------

Now that you've set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle `GET` requests for `/greeting`, optionally with a `name` parameter in the query string. The `GET` request should return a `200 OK` response with JSON in the body that represents a greeting. It should look something like this:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and `content` is the textual representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, you create a resource representation class. Provide a plain old java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content` data:

    <@snippet path="src/main/java/hello/Greeting.java" prefix="complete"/>

> **Note:** As you see in steps below, Spring uses the [Jackson JSON][jackson] library to automatically marshal instances of type `Greeting` into JSON.

Next you create the resource controller that will serve these greetings.


Create a resource controller
------------------------------

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are easily identified by the [`@Controller`][] annotation, and the `GreetingController` below handles `GET` requests for `/greeting` by returning a new instance of the `Greeting` class:

    <@snippet path="src/main/java/hello/GreetingController.java" prefix="complete"/>

This controller is concise and simple, but there's plenty going on under the hood. Let's break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

> **Note:** The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps all HTTP operations by default. Use `@RequestMapping(method=GET)` to narrow this mapping.

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the query string parameter `name` into the `name` parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query string parameter is not `required`; if it is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of "World" is used.

The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new `Greeting` object with `id` and `content` attributes based on the next value from the `counter`, and formats the given `name` by using the greeting `template`.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service controller above is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than relying on a view technology (such as [JSP][u-jsp]) to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to HTML, this RESTful web service controller simply populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The object data will be written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

To accomplish this, the [`@ResponseBody`][] annotation on the `greeting()` method tells Spring MVC that it does not need to render the greeting object through a server-side view layer, but that instead that the greeting object returned _is_ the response body, and should be written out directly.

The `Greeting` object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring's HTTP message converter support, you don't need to do this conversion manually. Because [Jackson 2][jackson] is on the classpath, Spring's [`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`][] is automatically chosen to convert the `Greeting` instance to JSON.


Make the application executable
-------------------------------

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional [WAR][u-war] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the [Tomcat][u-tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.

### Create an Application class

    <@snippet path="src/main/java/hello/Application.java" prefix="complete"/>

The `main()` method defers to the [`SpringApplication`][] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the [Spring application context][u-application-context].

The `@ComponentScan` annotation tells Spring to search recursively through the `hello` package and its children for classes marked directly or indirectly with Spring's [`@Component`][] annotation. This directive ensures that Spring finds and registers the `GreetingController`, because it is marked with `@Controller`, which in turn is a kind of `@Component` annotation.

The [`@EnableAutoConfiguration`][] annotation switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, because the application depends on the embeddable version of Tomcat (tomcat-embed-core.jar), a Tomcat server is set up and configured with reasonable defaults on your behalf. And because the application also depends on Spring MVC (spring-webmvc.jar), a Spring MVC [`DispatcherServlet`][] is configured and registered for you — no `web.xml` necessary! Auto-configuration is a powerful, flexible mechanism. See the [API documentation][`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] for further details.

<@build_an_executable_jar_subhead/>

<@build_an_executable_jar/>

<@run_the_application module="service"/>

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


Test the service
----------------

Now that the service is up, visit <http://localhost:8080/greeting>, where you see:

```json
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

Provide a `name` query string parameter with <http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User>. Notice how the value of the `content` attribute changes from "Hello, World!" to "Hello User!":

```json
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
```

This change demonstrates that the `@RequestParam` arrangement in `GreetingController` is working as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of "World", but can always be explicitly overridden through the query string.

Notice also how the `id` attribute has changed from `1` to `2`. This proves that you are working against the same `GreetingController` instance across multiple requests, and that its `counter` field is being incremented on each call as expected.
